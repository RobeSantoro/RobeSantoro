# Hi there... ðŸ‘‹

I'm [Robe Santoro](https://linktr.ee/robesantoro), a freelance 3D Generalist with over 15 years of experience in Motion Graphic Design and 3D Animation for Architectural Projection-Mapping.

During all those years as a *Wannabe Creative Coder*, I've done lots of `scripting` in Maya MEL and Python, creating custom tools to optimize processes and workflow for my team and me.  

During the first wave of the pandemic, I decided to extend my knowledge in programming, and I started a full-stack course, deepening my OOP skills on the one hand and learning the ThreeJS library on the other to bring my CG knowledge to the web.

Since 2022, I've also been using the Blender Python API to create tools for Matterport 3D Spaces for [Dimensione3](https://www.dimensione3.com/) and other tools and pipeline automation.

Check this repo [ReadyPlayerMe - Blender Tools](https://github.com/RobeSantoro/ReadyPlayerMe-Blender-Tools), a collection of Blender tools for helping explore the Ready Player Me API...

Recently, I started working on a Blender Addon to translate Blender scenes into Scrolling 3D experiences using React Three Fiber and Drei components: [Blender2React](https://github.com/RobeSantoro/Blender2React)

With it, I created [Publifest](https://publifest-3d-r3f.vercel.app/) and 4D Suite Touchwall experiences.
