# Hi there... ðŸ‘‹

I'm [Robe Santoro](https://linktr.ee/robesantoro), a freelance 3D Generalist with more than 10 years of experience in 3d Animation, Architectural Projection-Mapping, and Motion Graphic Design. I worked on [many projects](https://vimeo.com/robesantoro/videos) for clients such as Sony, Samsung, HTC, Vodafone, Philip Morris, and AUDI.

In 2018 I founded [Blending Pixels](https://www.blendingpixels.com/), a collective of artists, designers, and technicians specializing in content creation for large-scale projects, set and visual design for opera, and performing arts working on massive installations for concerts featuring Placido Domingo and Andrea Bocelli.

During those years, I fell in love with software architecture and abstractions. So I started a full-stack Bootcamp at Aulab Hackademy, deepening my OOP skills on the one hand and learning the ThreeJS library, on the other hand, to bring my CG knowledge to the web.

Since 2022, I'm also coding with python, creating workflows automation and custom tools/addons for Blender...
