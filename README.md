# Hi there... ðŸ‘‹

I'm a freelance Cg Artist with more than ten years of experience in 3d Animation, Architectural Projection-Mapping, and Motion Graphic Design. I worked on [many projects](https://vimeo.com/robesantoro) for clients such as Rotary International, SONY, Samsung,  HTC, INA, Vodafone, Philip Morris, and AUDI.

In 2018 I founded [Blending Pixels](https://www.blendingpixels.com/), a collective of artists, designers, and technicians, specializing in content creation for large-scale projects, set and visual design for opera, performing arts, and engaging, interactive experiences.

A few years ago, I started studying web development, specializing in the ThreeJS library to bring my CG knowledge to the web.

Since July '22, I'm also coding with python, creating automations and custom addons and tools for Blender...
