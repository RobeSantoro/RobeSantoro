# Hi there... ðŸ‘‹

I'm [Robe Santoro](https://linktr.ee/robesantoro), freelance Cg Artist with more than 10 years of experience in 3d Animation, Architectural Projection-Mapping, and Motion Graphic Design. I worked on [many projects](https://vimeo.com/robesantoro/videos) for clients such as Rotary International, SONY, Samsung,  HTC, INA, Vodafone, Philip Morris, and AUDI.

In 2018 I founded [Blending Pixels](https://www.blendingpixels.com/), a collective of artists, designers, and technicians, specializing in content creation for large-scale projects, set and visual design for opera, and performing arts working for massive concerts featuring Placido Domingo and Andrea Bocelli.

During those years, I fell in love with software architecture and abstractions. So I started a full-stack Bootcamp @Aulab.it, then deepening my OOP skills on the one hand and learning the ThreeJS library, on the other hand, to bring my CG knowledge to the web.
