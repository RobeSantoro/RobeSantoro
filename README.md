### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a freelance Cg Artist with more than ten years of experience in 3d Animation, Architectural Projection-Mapping, and Motion Graphic Design. I worked on many projects ranging from immersive projections for live performance to large-scale architectural mapping and interactive installations.

I'm obsessed with finding new techniques, workflows, styles and applying them using the latest technologies. I've got a great passion for every kind of interactive system, sensors, AR-VR-XR experiences, LED electronics, and the makers' world.

In 2018 I founded [Blending Pixels](https://www.blendingpixels.com/), a collective of artists, designers, and technicians, specializing in content creation for large-scale projects, set and visual design for opera, performing arts, and engaging, interactive experiences.

A few years ago, I started studying web development, specializing in the ThreeJS library to bring my CG knowledge to the web. Since July '22 I'm working also with python, creating custom tools for Blender...
