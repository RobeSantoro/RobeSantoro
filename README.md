# Hi there... ðŸ‘‹

I'm [Robe Santoro](https://linktr.ee/robesantoro), a freelance 3D Generalist with over 10 years of experience in Motion Graphic Design and 3D Animation for Architectural Projection-Mapping.

During those years, I've always done some `scripting` in Maya MEL and Python, creating custom tools to optimize processes and workflow for my team and me. During the first wave of the pandemic, I decided to extend my knowledge in web programming, and I started a full-stack course, deepening my OOP skills on the one hand and learning the ThreeJS library on the other to bring my CG knowledge to the web.

The following is a selection of projects/exercises I've done. All of them are open-source and free to use.  
Feel free to check them out:

- [Three JS Avatar Template](https://vite-three-js-avatar-template.vercel.app/)
- [Ready Player Me Avatar WASD Controller](https://three-js-avatar-controller.vercel.app/)

Since 2022, I'm also using the Blender Python API to create tools for Matterport 3D Spaces. I'm also working on a Blender Addon to translate Blender scenes into Scrolling 3D experiences using React Three Fiber and Drei components:
